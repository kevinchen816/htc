        <h2>Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information</h2>
        <ul class="styled">
            <li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because
                such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; ask a question; or initiate
                other transactions on our website.</li>
            <li>When you register on our website you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages and/or newsletters about product updates,
                improvements, special offers, or containing special distributions of content by us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive
                commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by clicking on the following link and entering the email address associated with your account:
                <a href="/email/optout">click here</a>. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to <a href="/email/optout">opt out</a>
                of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional
                and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, billing and invoicing notices without offering you the opportunity
                to opt out of receiving them. Please note that, changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of email communications will only affect
                future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner) before you
                have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</li>

        <a name="security"></a>
        <h2>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access
            and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.
            In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent
            unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p>
        <p>We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your
            information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also
            take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
