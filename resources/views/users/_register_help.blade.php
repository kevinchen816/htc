            We require a two step email verification for several reasons.  Primarily, it verifies you are
            who you are and that you have control over the email address you are using while also adding
            a second check that you have input the email correctly.

            It is important to us that we be able to correspond via email, for two main reasons.  Primarily,
            if we have trouble processing your credit card you will need to know about it.  If you elect to have the
            server send you email notifications, then you can be fairly confident they will make it once you have
            verified your email.
