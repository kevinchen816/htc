            <p>All Services purchased may be automatically renewed until the End User turns off the Auto-Bill option for that service. when End User elects to use
                the Auto-Bill feature, then End User authorizes the RidgeTec portal to automatically charge the Credit Card on file for End User's account the full
                amount for the plan chosen for the full duration.</p>

            <p>
                All data plan purchases are non refundable and unused standard plan Image Points expire at the end of the plan period.
            </p>

            <p>The standard data plans are billed for in advance. At the time of point of sale, End User selects the service plan
                which is represented clearly with duration and full cost.</p>

            <p>
                Some service plans may be initially offered with a FREE first month. Any renewals of these same plans will be at
                full price and the free month applies only to the very first month.
            </p>

            <p>End User agrees to use either a Credit Card, PayPal or other allowable payment method when purchasing a Service and agrees to authorize RidgeTec portal to
                automatically charge such payment method for future renewals and/or overages. End User further agrees to keep a valid Payment Method
                on file with RidgeTec at all times so such services may be billed for without declines. End User also agrees that End User will
                only utilize Payment Methods for which End User is legally authorize to use.
            </p>

            <p>All data plan purchases are billed for in entirety for their initital and stated duration.  Should End User elect to use the Auto-Bill option, then on the next
                renewal there will be a proration or discount applied based on the users existing Billing Cycle.  If this is End User's initital plan purchase
                then a Billing cycle is assigned and there is no proration on subsequent recurring billings/renewals for this data plan.</p>

            <p>
                All media file uploads to the RidgeTec portal will consume data in the form of Image Points from end User's Data Plan points or Points Reserve. For more
                information on Image Points, please read: <a href="/help/plans" target="_blank">PLAN INFO</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                As End User's device sends media files to the RidgeTec portal, data usage in the form of Image Points will be deducted from the plan's initial points.
                When/if a data plan is renewed, then the plan's Initial points will be reset and any remaining points are not carried forth or retained.
            </p>

            <p>
                End User may elect, at any time, to manually purchase a Points Reserve.  The value of the Points Reserve does not expire.  At any time data plan
                Points are exhausted, subsequent Device uploads, as Image Points, will be deducted from the Points Reserve.
                Should End User elect to use the <strong>Auto-Reserve</strong> feature then, End User authorizes RidgeTec Portal to automatically charge the Credit Card
                associated with the account for the Points Reserve amount specified under My Account | My Camera Data Plans, when/if the Points Reserve is exhausted (its value is 0).
            </p>

            <p>If at anytime during the plan period, plan points are exhausted, data usage as Image Points will continue to be deducted from the plan's Points Reserve.
                If there is no Points Reserve or the Points Reserve is exhausted then the plan associated with the Device will be suspended.  End User agrees
                and authorizes RidgeTec to suspend service for any plan which has used its period Image Points and Points reserve in entirety.
            </p>

            <p>

                Points Reserve.  The RidgeTec portal will at that time, re-activate the plan associated with the Device.  If a data plan has been suspened,
                End User will not be able to re-activate by purchasing a Points Reserve if today is beyond the plan's Service End Date.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to re-activate a data plan that is beyond its Service End Date, the End User should click the Renew Plan button.  The point of sale
                transaction and price will constitute the full amount for the plan chosen and End User may elect to change the plan terms (Tier) to a different duration,
                of which the disclosed price will be added to cart and charged in full.  Thus, once a Data Plan expires, and is suspended and beyond its Service End Date,
                the plan may be renewed with different terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                End User understands that by electing to uncheck both the Auto-Bill and Auto-Reserve options for their data plan, the RidgeTec portal will not be able to charge his credit
                card on file in any automated fashion.
