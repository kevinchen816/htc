        <h4 class="help-heading">Step 5: CREATE NEW PLAN:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the CREATE NEW PLAN button.</li>
            <li>The portal should indicate that your plan was added and if applicable indicate that a free month service was awarded.  </li>
            <li>At this point the server will send an activation signal to your SIM.  </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="help-block">Note: The SIM activation can take from several seconds to several minutes.</span>
    </div>


    <div class="alert alert-help">
        <h4 class="help-heading">Step 6: POWER UP CAMERA & VERIFY CONNECTION:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn camera switch to SET. Wait and monitor this screen for a cellular connection.</li>
            <li>On the bottom of the screen, look for ¡°Searching Network¡­¡±.</li>
            <li>If ¡°Cannot Find Network¡± is displayed, cycle power (turn camera OFF and then back to SETUP) until the camera connects to the network.</li>
            <span class="help-block">Note: The SIM activation can take from several seconds to several minutes. So, multiple retries are normal.  Please be patient as this is a network carrier delay and normally occurs.  If the camera does not find a network, it may mean you do not have service in your area. Move to a new area with better service and try again.</span>
            <li>Once the SIM activation is complete and a cellular connection is obtained, the screen will display a network name (the network name depends on model, carrier and location) along with signal strength in up to 5 bars.</li>
            <li>Next, Verify your web and portal connection by performing two diagnostic steps:</li>
            <div class="well">
            <li>Press MENU.</li>
            <li>Press down arrow three (3) times, select NETWORK TEST. (should return PASS). Press OK.</li>
            <span class="help-block">PASS means you are on the internet.</span>
            <li>Press down arrow, select REPORT TEST. (should return PASS). Press OK.</li>
            <span class="help-block">PASS means your camera is functioning 100% with the portal.</span>
            <span class="help-block">If both tests pass, your camera is 100% ready and the new camera is now added to your account and visible under MY CAMERAS in the portal and mobile application.</span>
            <li>Turn camera switch to ON.</li>
            </div>

          <span class="help-block">NOTE: by default the camera settings are not adjustable when Cellular Mode is ON (notice most menu items are greyed out).  This is by design as the camera will download the settings from the web portal.  If Cellular Mode is turned OFF, the camera settings can only be changed directly on the camera (camera will not transmit pictures when Cellular Mode is OFF). </span>
